For Reefscape, due to the large number of locations that the robot could score in, we knew that we couldn't just have another controller for our operator. We needed something that had substantially more inputs than a controller. This lead us to look at button boards, that we see many teams using things such as:

A physical button board was an option, but we wanted to explore solutions 'evergreen' solutions. This lead us to creating the app we internally refer to as 'Control Board'

## What is Control Board?
Control Board is a desktop app written in the Flutter framework built on Dart that interacts with the robot by pushing named values to network tables[^1] .

## How does the robot use Control Board Values?

In our 2025 code, we have a folder `\ControlBoard`. We use the `ControlBoardHelpers.java` to get and set the network table values for each of the control board items:
```java
public static int getLevel() {
	return (int) getEntry("/ControlBoard/Reef/Level").getDouble(0);
}

  public static void setLevel(int value) {
	getEntry("/ControlBoard/Reef/Level").setDouble(value);
}

// More Control Board Items...
```

We use these values to create a `RobotConfiguration` which contains information on where each part of the robot should be when traveling and scoring, as well as what End Effector state we are using to score in:
```java
public class RobotConfiguration {
    public final List<Pose2d> pathPoses;
    public final double finalArmAngle;
    public final double travelArmAngle;
    public final double finalWristAngle;
    public final double travelWristAngle;
    public final EndEffectorState startEndEffectorState;
    public EndEffectorState finalEndEffectorState;

    public RobotConfiguration(
        List<Pose2d> pathPoses,
        double finalArmAngle,
        double travelArmAngle,
        double finalWristAngle,  
        double travelWristAngle,
        EndEffectorState startEndEffectorState,
        EndEffectorState finalEndEffectorState) {

		this.pathPoses = pathPoses;
        this.finalArmAngle = finalArmAngle;
        this.travelArmAngle = travelArmAngle;
        this.finalWristAngle = finalWristAngle;
        this.travelWristAngle = travelWristAngle;
        this.startEndEffectorState = startEndEffectorState;
        this.finalEndEffectorState = finalEndEffectorState;
    }
}
```

To create a `RobotConfiguration` we call the static functions inside `RobotConfigProvider.java`. Depending on the criteria gathered from the control board, referenced like:
```java
String reefLocation = ControlBoardHelpers.getReefLocation();
int reefLevel = (int) ControlBoardHelpers.getLevel();
```

we can return a `RobotConfiguration` generated from those control board values
```java
return switch (reefLevel) {
	case ControlBoardConstants.REEF_LEVEL_ALGAE ->
		createAlgaeRemovalConfiguration(reefLocation, currPose);

	case ControlBoardConstants.REEF_LEVEL_TROUGH ->
		createTroughScoringConfiguration(reefLocation, currPose);

	case ControlBoardConstants.REEF_LEVEL_2 ->
	createLevel2ScoringConfiguration(reefLocation, currPose, currHeading);

	case ControlBoardConstants.REEF_LEVEL_3 ->
		createLevel3ScoringConfiguration(reefLocation, currPose);

	default -> null;
};
```

We then pass the `RobotConfiguration` back to the `RobotSubsystem` where we integrate it into our state machine.
```java
switch (robotState) {
	case T_TRAVELING:
		arm.setTargetAngle(config.travelArmAngle);
		wrist.setTargetAngle(config.travelWristAngle);
		if (currentPathCommand == null || !currentPathCommand.isScheduled()) 
		{
			Command otfPath = drivebase.pathfindToOTFPath(config.pathPoses);
			Command driverCancel = new WaitUntilCommand(() -> RobotContainer.isDriverInputDetected());
			currentPathCommand = new ParallelRaceGroup(otfPath, driverCancel)
					.andThen(new InstantCommand(() -> {
						drivebase.setState(DriveState.USER_CONTROLLED);
					}, drivebase));
			currentPathCommand.schedule();
		}
		robotState = RobotState.P_PATHING;
		break;
	// More Robot State Logic...
```

## What else does Control Board do?

Control board handles the auto selection, while showing a gif of the selected auto, so that you can preview what the robot intends to do. We can also add Boolean viewers, such as whether or not we have a coral and the clamp state of the climb. We included a game time so the operator can make decisions based on how much time remains in the match.
