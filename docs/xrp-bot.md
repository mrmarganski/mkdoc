# XRP Bot Creation and Development

## Introduction to XRP Bots

XRP Bots are specialized robots designed for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). In this section, you'll learn how to create and develop your own XRP bot using the latest tools and technology available to our team.

## Key Components

1. **Chassis**
   - The base structure of your robot.
   - It can be made from materials like aluminum or steel.

2. **Drive Train**
   - This is the mechanism that allows your robot to move.
   - Common types: tank drive, mecanum, and swerve.

3. **Programming**
   - Learn how to code your robot to make it do what you want.
   - We use **Java** or **LabVIEW** for programming FRC robots.

4. **Electronics**
   - Wiring and connecting all the components to the robot's control system.

5. **Sensors and Actuators**
   - Use sensors like encoders, cameras, and gyros to gather data and control the robot.
   - Actuators control movement, like motors and servos.
