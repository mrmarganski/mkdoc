# FRC Design Learning Course

!!! note
    This page was copied from the frcdesign.org for practice in implementing their markdown formatting - we also want to look at created a team hub where members can get information from a singular source instead of bouncing around sites - we will giv credit to frcdesign.org at all times we implement their content if this is a direction we take. 

```python { .copy }
print("Hello, world!")
```

Welcome to the design learning course, the main purpose and content of the website! Keep in mind that it's always a work in progress, so if you find any issues or have difficulty understanding something, please reach out to a member!

The purpose of the course is to take you from zero to being able to model a full robot. The content focuses on FRC-relevant features and tools, using engaging projects that not only introduce new CAD skills and practice old ones but also introduce engineering concepts. These projects gradually get less guided as you progress.

!!! tip
    Despite how it looks, Onshape is quite different in its fundamentals from other CAD software. Start at [Stage 0A](stage0/0A/what-and-why-CAD.md) if you're switching from another CAD software or new to CAD, and [Stage 1A](stage1/1A/introduction.md) if you already have some experience using Onshape.  
    **You will struggle with later stages** if you don't have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of Onshape.

!!! warning
    If you choose to skip to Stage 0, make sure to add [MKCAD](stage0/0B/MKCad.md) and the [required featurescripts](stage0/0B/featurescripts.md) for the learning course.

!!! warning
    Before starting, remember to take a look at the [website feature guide](../website-feature-guide.md) to gain an understanding of the different features used throughout the learning course!
