            <h3>The Why</h3>
            <p>You possess strong spatial reasoning and a desire to understand how systems fit together. You don't just want to build something; you want to design it so it works perfectly before the first piece of metal is ever cut. In FRC, a robot without CAD is a nightmare to repair. We need architects who can plan mechanisms, ensure packaging constraints, and communicate their vision to the fabrication team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="result-section">
            <h3>What You Need to Learn Next</h3>
            <p>To advance in CAD, you need to transition from "making 3D shapes" to "engineering mechanical systems." This means learning how to read the FRC Game Manual for size constraints, understanding basic kinematics (how things move), and mastering "Design for Manufacturing" (DFM)—making sure the parts you draw can actually be built in our shop.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="result-section">
            <h3>Key Skills to Master</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Onshape Mastery:</strong> Top-down design, master sketching, and using FeatureScripts (like the gear generator).</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanical Principles:</strong> Calculating gear ratios, understanding torque vs. speed, and selecting the right motors.</li>
                <li><strong>Assembly Management:</strong> Properly mating parts so the virtual robot moves exactly like the real one will.</li>
            </ul>

      title: "🛠️ Recommended Track: Advanced Fabrication",
      desc: `
        <div class="result-section">
            <h3>The Why</h3>
            <p>You are a tactile learner who thrives on tangible results. You have patience, respect for tools, and you understand that a design on a screen is useless if it can't be manufactured in reality. Fabrication isn't just cutting metal; it is high-precision manufacturing. We need builders who can operate the machines and assemble gearboxes with zero slop.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="result-section">
            <h3>What You Need to Learn Next</h3>
            <p>To advance in Fabrication, you need to learn the language of tolerances and materials. You will learn why aluminum is used instead of steel, how to read a CAD drawing to make a physical part, and the concept of "Speeds and Feeds" (how fast a machine should cut based on the material).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="result-section">
            <h3>Key Skills to Master</h3>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Precision Measurement:</strong> Mastering the use of digital calipers and micrometers (a difference of 0.01 inches matters!).</li>
                <li><strong>Assembly & Wiring:</strong> Properly riveting chassis frames, tapping threads, and routing clean electrical wires.</li>

            <h3>The Why</h3>
            <p>You enjoy abstract logic, troubleshooting, and making inanimate objects "think." You have the patience to dig through code and the curiosity to figure out why a system isn't behaving properly. An FRC robot without code is just a very expensive paperweight. It requires deep focus and resilience to failure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="result-section">
            <h3>What You Need to Learn Next</h3>
            <p>To advance in Programming, you need to move beyond simple "if/then" statements. You will need to learn Control Theory (how to make a motor spin to an exact position without shaking), how to read data from sensors (like gyros and cameras), and how to structure code so other people can read it.</p>

            <h3>The Why</h3>
            <p>You understand that a robotics team is actually a small business. You naturally gravitate towards communication, art, organization, and visual storytelling. The most prestigious award in FRC (The Impact Award) isn't won by a robot; it is won by the Media and Business teams. You build the team's identity.</p>

            <h3>The Why</h3>
            <p>You see the big picture. You enjoy game theory, analyzing data, and figuring out how to outsmart an opponent rather than just overpowering them. FRC events are won in the spreadsheets. A mediocre robot with brilliant strategy will routinely beat a brilliant robot with poor strategy. We need data-driven minds to act as the tactical brains behind the Drive Team.</p>

        <div class="result-section">
            <h3>What You Need to Learn Next</h3>
            <p>To advance in Strategy, you need to learn Statistical Analysis and UI/UX design. You will learn how to look at 60 matches worth of data, filter out the noise, and present the Drive Team with a 3-bullet-point plan on how to win the next match.</p>
