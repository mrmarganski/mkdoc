## 0. File Creation to Be Lasered
Before we even use the machine, we need a 2D PDF file of our contours of the shapes we will want to cut:

1. On a computer, create a file on OnShape you plan to make
2. Create a drawing of the file (Ensure scaling is 1:1)
3. Export the file as PDF (Turn off.delete unnecessary lines/centerlines labels/text you do not want - only should see the lines you actually want to cut)
4. Verify file opens and save to a USB drive to transfer to the machine later on step 3 below.

## 1. Safety First 🛡️
Before you even turn the machine on, perform these checks:

* [ ] **Safety Glasses:** Never look at laser while cutting, Lid must be closed to operate.
* [ ] **Exhaust System:** Ensure the machine is in the **Paint Room** with vent fan **ON** and clear of obstructions.
* [ ] **Fire Extinguisher:** Locate the nearest extinguisher.
* [ ] **Workspace:** Ensure no flammable scraps are sitting on the honeycomb bed.

## 2. Machine Startup
Follow this specific power-on sequence:

1. Ensure power strip is on and all components plugged in, **Should hear pumps running**
2. Verify water is in 5 -Gallon Bucket and water is running through the pump
3. Turn on the main power switch **Keyed Lock to ON Position**.
4. Unlock the Emergency Stop **E-Stop** if depressed.
5. Open **Retina Engrave** Software and ensure **Connected** in lower left corner.
6. Home the Machine pressing **Home** Icon
7. Wait for the laser head to **Home** (move to the corner).
8. After machine is homes, yout can use **Arrow Keys** on the laptop to move the laser head to a new position.

## 3. Preparing Your File
Projects start in **Retina Engrave**, but need to be **Printed** to send file to Software.

* **Insert USB:** Plug `USB` Drive into laptop **Open folder files are stored in to be lasered**.
* **Opening:** Open `.pdf` file (Double-Click/Right-Click - Open) to **Preview It in Google Chrome**.
* **Importing:** Print `.pdf` file to **Full Sprecturm Engraver** Which is a printer selected in the menu.
* **Scaling:** Ensure your dimensions match your physical material 1:1.
* **Layers:** Assign different colors for **Cutting** (Line) vs. **Engraving** (Fill).

!!! tip "Layer Logic"
    Always set your **Engraving** layers to happen *before* your **Cutting** layers so the part doesn't shift.

## 4. Material Setup & Focusing
This is the most important step for a clean result.

1. Place your material flat on the bed (12"x20" MAX BUILD SIZE).
2. Use the **Focus Tool** to set the correct distance between the lens and the material.  (You may have to move machine head to a different location to be on your workpiece and can fit the focus tool under the laser head)
3. There is a **Turn Handle** Underneath the machine, turn it to move the machine **Floor** to the proper height so the Focus Tool is just below the laser head when resting on your workpiece.
 4. Manually move the laser head to the "Origin" (where you want the job to start **Typically Top Left Corner of Job**).

## 5. Speed & Power Settings
Refer to the **Material Library** at the tool station. Common starting points:

| Material | Mode | Speed (%) | Power (%) | Passes (#) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1/8" Plywood | Cut | 10% | 100% | 3 |
| Plywood | Engrave | 80% | 50% | 1 |
| 1/8" Acrylic | Cut | 15% | 100% | 3 |
| Acrylic | Engrave | 80% | 50% | 1 |

## 6. The "Perimeter" Check
Before firing the laser, press the **[PERIMETER STEPS]** button in the software.

> **Why?** This moves the laser head in a rectangle around your design area. Check to make sure the laser won't hit machine limits or go off the edge of the material.

---

## 7. Run the Job 🚀
1. Close the laser lid/shroud.
2. Double-check that the air assist is blowing.
3. Click **Start**.

!!! danger "Never Leave the Machine Unattended"
    You must stay within **line of sight** of the laser at all times during operation. Do not leave the woodshop area, or the laser unsupervised. If you see a flame, hit the E-Stop immediately.

---

## 8. Cleanup
* [ ] Wait 30 seconds for smoke to clear before opening the lid.
* [ ] Remove your project and any small "drop" scraps from the bed.
* [ ] Turn off the machine and exhaust fan.
* [ ] Clean the work area for the next student.
